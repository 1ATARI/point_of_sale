# Point of sale



This site is for the point of sale, you can create, read, update, delete, (user (admin), Categories, Products, Clients, Orders)
and give user(admin) permissions to create, read, update, and delete (user (admin), Categories, products, Clients, orders)


the libraries I use are

laratrust for permissions and teams authorization

Laravel Localization (mcamara) for localization for Laravel

Laravel-translatable for store translation as JSON instead of DataBase

Intervention Image provides an easier and more expressive way to create, edit, and compose images 

PHPFlasher for flash messages  (notification)


<h5>I recommend to use it in English to get the best experience</h5>


There are many bugs in the design because I downloaded it in both Arabic and English
Not from the official website, but from someone who modified it to suit Arabic and English
I had to solve a lot of problems with it in CSS and Arabic bootstrap
